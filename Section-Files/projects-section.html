                                            <p style="font-size: 16px;">This project applies machine learning techniques to classify brain tumors using MRI images. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle with four tumor categories—glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor—it involves preprocessing the images (resizing and flattening), then training K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning models. Model performance is evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with visual insights provided via confusion matrices and heatmaps.</p>

                                            <p style="font-size: 16px;">This program is a simple TCP-based client-server chat application written in C, where a client can connect to a server and exchange messages interactively. The server, implemented in server.c and server.h, initializes a socket, binds to a specified address and port (9001), and waits for client connections. When a client connects, the server enters a message exchange loop, allowing both sides to send messages until either sends "exit" or disconnects. The client, implemented in client.c and client.h, establishes a connection to the server and records both sent and received messages in a transcript.txt file. The program handles socket creation, connection management, message exchange, and cleanup, making it a straightforward example of TCP communication between a client and server.</p>

                                            <p style="font-size: 16px;">The Python program retrieves real-time weather data from the WeatherAPI, processes it, and stores it in a MySQL database using an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) approach. First, the getAPIResponse function extracts data by sending a GET request to the API, returning the JSON response if successful. Next, getAPIInfo transforms this JSON data by parsing and organizing relevant information (such as local time, location, temperature, and wind speed) into a list format. Finally, the transferToDatabase function loads the transformed data into a MySQL database named "WeatherData" by executing an SQL insert command. The main function integrates these steps, constructs the API URL, and prompts the user for a city or zipcode to retrieve weather data. The Python program is modular, with clear separation of the ETL stages, enabling efficient data processing and easy maintenance.</p>

The app implements UIIMagePicker to classify whatever animal you take a picture of. The app will also implement notifications to remind the user to get on the app and do their daily animal finding. The goal of this app is to have the user collect animals and learn about ones they don't know about in a digital way.</p>
